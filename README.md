Fork of the Official repo of the [BareMetal](https://github.com/ReturnInfinity/BareMetal-kernel) [exokernel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exokernel).

It's pretty much a glued-together version of [BareMetal-OS](https://github.com/ReturnInfinity/BareMetal-OS) and [BareMetal-kernel](https://github.com/ReturnInfinity/BareMetal-kernel) so I can develop applications with raw disk access AND drawing capabilities.
